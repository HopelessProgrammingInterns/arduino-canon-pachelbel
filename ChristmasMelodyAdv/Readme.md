# Advanced Christmas Melody

This is an advanced version of the original Christmas Melody implementation. The two main differences are 1) that it plays a given melody without user input, allowing the user to optinally specify a different duration for each note; and 2) to have multiple arduinos play in sync in a master/slave setup. It also uses the led as a metronome which can help debugging melody and synchronisation problems.

## Architecture

1. There is one master arduino, which outputs a clock signal on the (digital) `MASTER_PIN`. Each tick the signal switches from `HIGH` to `LOW` or vice versa. Each tick signifies a 32nd note.
2. The master will only send a clock signal on every second reset, this allows one to set up the other slaves, before they start receiving the clock signal.
3. There are any number of slave arduinos who's (digital) `SLAVE_PIN` is connected to the master's `MASTER_PIN` (a slave may be it's own master).
4. The slaves play the next note in their melody, holding it for the required number of ticks.
5. The slaves use the builtin `tone(pin, hz)` function to continuously play the note until `noTone()` is called. `tone()` uses one of the arduinos timer's to generate the sound 'asynchronously' (using interrupts).
6. The master uses the [TimerOne](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/TimerOne) library to send the clock signal every `n` microseconds (calculated based on the defined BPM), also 'asynchronously' (using interrupts).
7. All `digital(Read|Write)` calls  are replaced by the `digital(Read|Write)Safe` (inline) functions from the [digitalIOPerformance](https://github.com/projectgus/digitalIOPerformance) library, which should be 28 times faster, taking only two cycles instead of 56 ([source](http://www.billporter.info/2010/08/18/ready-set-oscillate-the-fastest-way-to-change-arduino-pins/), tested with a different library but should be comparable) (this works only when the pin number is known at compile time).
